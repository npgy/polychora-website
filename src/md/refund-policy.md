# Refund Policy

Effective Date: 03/17/2025

At Polychora LLC, we strive to provide a seamless fulfillment experience. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds are granted for our fulfillment services.

1. Eligibility for a Full Refund
   If you have signed up for our fulfillment service but have not yet used the service—meaning no orders have been fulfilled and no costs have been incurred by Polychora LLC—you are eligible for a full refund. Upon processing the refund, your service will be canceled immediately.

2. Cancellation After Service Usage

If you have used our services in any capacity, including having any orders fulfilled or other costs incurred by Polychora LLC on your behalf, you are not eligible for a full refund.

You may still cancel your service at any time, but it will remain active for the remainder of the current subscription period, and no prorated refunds will be issued.

3. Requesting a Refund
   To request a refund, please contact us at nick@polychora.co with your account details. If you meet the eligibility criteria, we will process your refund within 7 business days.

4. Changes to This Policy
   Polychora LLC reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Continued use of our services after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

For any questions, please reach out to us at nick@polychora.co.
